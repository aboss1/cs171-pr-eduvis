###Background and Motivation

Upon viewing data visualizations that displayed self-segregation in U.S states, we realized that we were interested in the correlation between the education system and demographics of the students. As a group, we have a very strong interest in inequality in the US public education system. Some of our teammates have background in researching education policy. 

###Project Objectives

In this project, we want to better understand the systemic components of the US education system. There are several parts to this: race, socioeconomic status, geographic location, funding, etc. We want to take these parts and show how they are interrelated and how it impacts each individual’s education. There is a common perception that “Education is the great equalizer,” but there are many other factors involved. In this project, we want to explore those factors.

###Data
We use data from National Center for Education Statistics. From this list, we use, race, economic status,  geographic location and funding and compare them. Hopefully we show the result on the map so that users can easily recognize the difference due to each factor.

###Data Processing
All the data is in .csv format so we will have little data processing to do. However, the information concerning specific states are separate from one another, so in that respect, we will have to download multiple files and combine them.

###Visualization
We hope to have several components in our visualisation. Most of it will be visualized vis-a-vis a map. The map will be the basis for our project. On top of it, we will use colors/saturation to demonstrate demographics. Hovering over each district will provide more specific information. Furthemore, we will use force-directed layout between districts to demonstrate the effects of self-segregation on educational attainment. There will also be graphs breaking down each component, showing the exact numbers instead of just density via colors.

###Must-Have Features
A map of the US that allows the user to examine the demographic breakdown of the education system. We also want to work with force-directed layout to demonstrate self-segregation effects and what is commonly known as “white flight”. Colors/saturation of the map dependent on demographics and density based on numbers are must-have features.
###Optional Features 
Extra graphs beyond the map giving a clearer, numerical visualisation.
###Project Schedule
*Tentative to change*:

* April 4-7:  Solidify individual roles, begin process book 
* April 7-10: Clean up and extract data from source, create hierarchal structure for our visualization site 
* April 10-14: Implement map of the US that displays one of the above listed demographics
* April 15-17: Implement at least two more demographics with respect to the US map, and clean up code for Milestone 1

	**Milestone 1**

* April 20-26: Meet TF and Get Feedback
* April 17-24: Finish all demographics, make sure hovering is complete
* April 24-26: Test current visualization to ensure it is robust
* April 26-30: Begin adding additional features
* May 1- May 5: Test for bugs and finalize process book
* May 5: Project due
